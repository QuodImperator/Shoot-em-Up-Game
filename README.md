# Shoot 'em Up Game
This is a game I made by myself in Unity, the built game is in the "Game" folder, whereas the code is in the .sln file.
## How to play
The game is quite simple, movement is omni-directional and done with the arrow keys, the gun is shot with "Space" and fires as fast as you can press, the goal is to get as many points as possible by destroying enemies, get hit 3 times and you will die. Upon death, you may restart the game and try again!
## How does it work?
The game, as previously mentioned, is created in Unity, utilizing their blank 2D game project, the game is fundamentally a collection od "Game Objects" which hold various parts and logic of the game, for example the "Main Camera" object holds what and where can we see, the "Player Plane" object holds the Sprite of the plane, a script for it's movement logic and so on.
